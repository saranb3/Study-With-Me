## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s and consists of the following steps:

1. Decide on a task to be done
2. Set the timer to 25 minutes (one Pomodoro)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

This technique helps improve focus, manage distractions, and maintain mental freshness.
